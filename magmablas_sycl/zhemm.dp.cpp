/***************************************************************************//**
    Purpose
    -------
    ZHEMM performs one of the matrix-matrix operations

        C := alpha*A*B + beta*C,
    or
        C := alpha*B*A + beta*C,

    where alpha and beta are scalars, A is a Hermitian matrix, and
    B and C are m by n matrices.

    Arguments
    ---------
    @param[in]
    side    magma_side_t
            On entry, side specifies whether the Hermitian matrix A
            appears on the left or right in the operation as follows:

            SIDE = MagmaLeft    C := alpha*A*B + beta*C,
            SIDE = MagmaRight   C := alpha*B*A + beta*C.


    @param[in]
    uplo    magma_uplo_t
            On entry, uplo specifies whether the upper or lower
            triangular part of the Hermitian matrix A is to be
            referenced as follows:

            uplo = MagmaUpper   Only the upper triangular part of the
                                Hermitian matrix is to be referenced.
            uplo = MagmaLower   Only the lower triangular part of the
                                Hermitian matrix is to be referenced.

    @param[in]
    m       INTEGER
            On entry, m specifies the number of rows of C.
            m >= 0.

    @param[in]
    n       INTEGER
            On entry, n specifies the number of columns of C.
            n >= 0.

    @param[in]
    alpha   COMPLEX*16
            On entry, alpha specifies the scalar alpha.

    @param[in]
    dA      COMPLEX*16 array A of DIMENSION ( ldda, ka ), where ka is
            m when side = MagmaLower and is n otherwise.
            Before entry with side = MagmaLeft, the m by m part of
            the array A must contain the Hermitian matrix, such that
            when uplo = MagmaUpper, the leading m by m upper triangular
            part of the array A must contain the upper triangular part
            of the Hermitian matrix and the strictly lower triangular
            part of A is not referenced, and when uplo = MagmaLower,
            the leading m by m lower triangular part of the array A
            must contain the lower triangular part of the Hermitian
            matrix and the strictly upper triangular part of A is not
            referenced.
            Before entry with side = MagmaRight, the n by n part of
            the array A must contain the Hermitian matrix, such that
            when uplo = MagmaUpper, the leading n by n upper triangular
            part of the array A must contain the upper triangular part
            of the Hermitian matrix and the strictly lower triangular
            part of A is not referenced, and when uplo = MagmaLower,
            the leading n by n lower triangular part of the array A
            must contain the lower triangular part of the Hermitian
            matrix and the strictly upper triangular part of A is not
            referenced.
            Note that the imaginary parts of the diagonal elements need
            not be set, they are assumed to be zero.

    @param[in]
    ldda    INTEGER
            On entry, ldda specifies the first dimension of A as declared
            in the calling (sub) program.
            When side = MagmaLower then ldda >= max( 1, m ),
            otherwise                   ldda >= max( 1, n ).

    @param[in]
    dB      COMPLEX*16 array B of DIMENSION ( lddb, n ).
            Before entry, the leading m by n part of the array B must
            contain the matrix B.

    @param[in]
    lddb    INTEGER
            On entry, lddb specifies the first dimension of B as declared
            in the calling (sub) program. LDDB >= max( 1, m ).

    @param[in]
    beta    COMPLEX*16
            On entry, BETA specifies the scalar beta. When BETA is
            supplied as zero then C need not be set on input.

    @param[in,out]
    dC      COMPLEX*16 array C of DIMENSION ( lddc, n ).
            Before entry, the leading m by n part of the array C must
            contain the matrix C, except when beta is zero, in which
            case C need not be set on entry.
            On exit, the array C is overwritten by the m by n updated
            matrix.

    @param[in]
    lddc    INTEGER
            On entry, lddc specifies the first dimension of C as declared
            in the calling (sub) program. lddc >= max( 1, m ).

    @param[in]
    queue   magma_queue_t
            Queue to execute in.
